        <h2>Why LHC?</h2>
        <h3 id ="s2">Importance of LHC</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest particle accelerator, built at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland, during the period from 1998 to December 2008. The circumference of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is about 27 km, along which hadrons are accelerated by beams of light and collide with each other at specific points. The LHC is a tunnel passing through the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva at a depth of 50-175 meters.</p>
            <p>The LHC contains an accelerator and several detectors installed around the collision points of hadrons. Particles are accelerated to energies of 7 TeV, resulting in a collision energy of 14 TeV. These indicators are captured by key detectors such as ATLAS and CMS. The LHC is the most complex facility ever built by humanity. Individual components were built over decades and tested in hundreds of laboratories.</p>
            <p>Antimatter is the opposite form of matter, where particles have opposite charges and quantum properties. The existence and study of antimatter allow for a better understanding of the fundamental laws of nature and open up potential for the development of new technologies and applications in the modern world.</p>
            <p>Antimatter arises from interactions of high energies, such as those occurring during high-energy nuclear reactions or in cosmic processes. It can also be created in laboratory conditions, for example, in particle collision experiments with particle accelerators.</p>
            <p>Hadrons (from the Greek "hadros," meaning "bulky") are particles composed of quarks. Protons and neutrons, which make up atomic nuclei, belong to this family. On the other hand, leptons are particles that do not consist of quarks. Electrons and muons are examples of leptons (from the Greek "leptos," meaning "fine").</p>
            <p>A quark is a fundamental particle that, together with electrons and neutrinos, is a building block of matter. Quarks are considered elementary particles, meaning they are not composed of smaller particles.</p>
            <p>Spin is an intrinsic property of elementary particles, and its direction is an important degree of freedom. Spin can be represented as a vector, the length of which is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant ħ (pronounced as "h bar"). For quarks, measuring the spin vector component along any axis can only give values of + ħ /2 or - ħ /2; for this reason, quarks are classified as particles with a spin of 1⁄2.</p>

        <h3 id ="s3">Website's mission</h3>
        <div>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to explore antimatter and the Hadron Collider, their working principles, research results, and prospects in these fields.</p>
            <p>Within the scope of the research, the following will be considered: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Structure of the Hadron Collider and its role in science</li>
                <li>Essence of antimatter</li>
                <li>Impact of antimatter on human life</li>
                <li>Complexity of antimatter production</li>
                <li>Quarks, Higgs boson, Gluon</li>
                <li>Spin</li>
            </ul>
        <p>By analyzing these factors, we hope to understand how the hadron collider was built, and how the discovery of antimatter has affected humanity, what it has brought, and what it can bring.</p>
